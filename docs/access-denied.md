## Troubleshooting access denied issues

This page is here to troubleshoot access denied issues you run into when using `org-formation`. Typically this has to do with a misconfigured or missing cross-account role - by default this is `OrganizationAccountAccessRole`. org-formation also supports non-default role names by using `--cross-account-role-name` as a [command line option](https://github.com/org-formation/org-formation-cli/blob/master/docs/cli-reference.md#org-formation-init) during init or by setting the `DefaultOrganizationAccessRoleName` attribute on your `OC::ORG::OrganizationRoot`. This value can also be overwritten for every account using the `OrganizationAccessRoleName` on your `OC::ORG::Account`s. For further information see the [organization resources page](https://github.com/org-formation/org-formation-cli/blob/master/docs/organization-resources.md).


#### I just created the account using org-formation

Please rerun the process: as all things AWS are eventually consistent it could be that the cross-account role (default `OrganizationAccountAccessRole`) still needs to be created.

Do let me know in [the issues](https://github.com/OlafConijn/AwsOrganizationFormation/issues) if this problem doesn't resolve on its own or if you run into this a lot!


#### I have an account that joined my organization

It could be that the cross-account role (default `OrganizationAccountAccessRole`) is missing. please log into the account and create the Role manually. There is a CloudFormation template at the bottom of this page.


#### I created the account in the AWS Organizations console

Please check the cross-account role is present in the console created account. By default this is `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` but also check your organization configuration to see if a non-default value is being used. If the role is missing, please log into the account and create the Role manually. There is a CloudFormation template at the bottom of this page. You may need to adjust the role name.


#### CloudFormation template to create the OrganizationAccountAccessRole

**Note**: if you copied the `DenyChangeOfOrgRoleSCP` Policy from the [example organization](../examples/organization.yml) to your organization, make sure you temporarily detach it. Otherwise CloudFormation will fail with an `explicit deny`.

If you did not copy the `DenyChangeOfOrgRoleSCP` Policy into your organization, you might want to consider this. It explicitly denies anyone to change the Role below.

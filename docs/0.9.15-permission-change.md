## Breaking change in org-formation version 0.9.15

Applies to anyone that initialized an org-formation project using version 0.9.14 using a delegated build account e.g:
`npx org-formation init-pipeline --region us-east-1 --build-account-id 112233445566`

**Background and motivation**
Delegated build accounts are introduced in version 0.9.14 to make permissions management easier as there is no need to deploy/run any resources from within the organization management account. The delegated build account uses an IAM Role called `OrganizationFormationBuildAccessRole` to access other accounts.

In v0.9.14 the `OrganizationFormationBuildAccessRole` IAM role was only assumed for cross account access and not local account access (if a resource is deployed to the build account itself). In order to make permissions management easier from v0.9.15 onwards all access will use the `OrganizationFormationBuildAccessRole` Role. This allows organization wide SCPs and other access controls to uniquely identify org-formation access by role name.

**Identifying compatibility issues**

You are likely have ran into this issue if your org-formation build has failed with the following message:

```
WARN: ======================================'
WARN: Hi there!
WARN: You just ran into an error when assuming the role OrganizationFormationBuildAccessRole in account 112233445566. (112233445566 = BuildAccountName)
WARN: Possibly, this is due a breaking change in org-formation v0.9.15.
WARN: From v0.9.15 onwards the org-formation cli will assume a role in every account it deploys tasks to.
WARN: This will make permission management and SCPs to deny / allow org-formation tasks easier.
WARN: Thanks!

```

**Resolving issues**

1. In your org-formation project source, search for the task `OrganizationFormationRole`. The default location for this task is in the file `000-organization-buildorganization-tasks.yml`, line 39.
2. Remove the line `ExcludeAccount: !Ref <BuildAccountName>` from the tasks DefaultOrganizationBinding. BuildAccountName will likely have a different name within your organization.
3. Retry running the build

an example of what this task looks like:

```yaml
OrganizationFormationRole:
  Type: update-stacks
  DependsOn: MasterOrganizationFormationRole
  Template: ./org-formation-role.yml
  StackName: !Sub "${resourcePrefix}-role"
  StackDescription: Organization Formation Build Infrastructure (IAM Role for cross account access by build process)
  TerminationProtection: true
  DefaultOrganizationBindingRegion: !Ref primaryRegion
  DefaultOrganizationBinding:
    IncludeMasterAccount: false
    Account: "*"
    ExcludeAccount: !Ref <BuildAccountName> # !!! <-- remove this entire line
  MaxConcurrentStacks: 10
  Parameters:
    assumeRolePrincipal: !Ref <BuildAccountName> # you could tighten this up with: !CopyValue [!Sub "${resourcePrefix}-build-role-id", !Ref <BuildAccountName>, !Ref primaryRegion]
  TaskRoleName: !GetAtt CurrentAccount.OrganizationAccessRoleName
  TaskViaRoleArn: !Sub "arn:aws:iam::${MasterAccount}:role/OrganizationFormationBuildAccessRole"
```
